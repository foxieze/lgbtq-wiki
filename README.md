# Better LGBTQIA+ Wiki

I have never been a fan of any of the current Fandom
based wiki pages for LGBTQIA+ terms and a lot of the time
I find that I need to visit multiple sites to get all
the information that I want at that time. Because of this, I decided
that I would make a new wiki that's simple and easy to use
for everyone and has as much information as I could think of.
