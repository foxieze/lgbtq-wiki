      <h2>Types of Attraction</h2>
      <p>There are many different types of attraction (5 main ones are listed below) and this
          can be very confusing, especially if you are trying to work out how to label yourself! 
          I've tried to explain each of these as simply as possible while still providing as much
          detail as possible. The first 2 below (sexual, romantic), you are most likely to encounter,
          so I would focus on understanding what these mean. 
      </p>
    <div class="sexualAttractionHelp">
      <h3>Sexual Attraction</h3>
      <p>
        Sexual attraction is exactly how it sounds:
        <i
          >having the desire to be with someone on a physical and intimate
          level.</i
        >
        Or in simpler terms:
        <i>the desire to kiss someone or have sex with them...</i>
        <br />
        When we hear the word 'attraction', we have grown up to often default
        this to mean 'sexual attraction'. However, it's important to understand
        that this is not the case and that it is just one of a wide breadth of
        experiences.
      </p>
      <h3>Romantic Attraction</h3>
      <p>
        Romantic attraction tends to be a deeper form of attraction, as it is a
        desire for a connection that is not strictly about sex. The easiest way
        I have heard this described is it's like
        <i>falling in love with someone</i>. These types of relationships share
        much of the same traits as a regular friendship would, however they
        extend much further beyond a friendship and tend to register more
        profoundly than existing friendships.
      </p>
      <h3>Physical Attraction</h3>
      <p>
        Physical Attraction can easily be confused with sexual attraction,
        however, they are very much not the same thing. I think the easiest
        comparison to make is that sexual attraction is
        <strong>sexual</strong> (ie. sex, kissing, etc.), whereas physical
        attraction doesn't have to be. Physical attraction could be hugs,
        cuddles, holding hands, among many other things.
      </p>
      <h3>Emotional Attraction</h3>
      <p>
        Emotional attraction can best be described as a desire for intimacy, or
        a close relationship (whether as friends or something more than that).
        Emotional attraction is sharing your hopes, dreams and fears. It's a
        shared experience of expressing/receiving love. It's respecting the
        other member(s) of the relationship and giving them support when they
        need it most. I think it's already been made clear but a relationship
        like this can exist both romantically and platonically.
      </p>
      <h3>Aesthetic Attraction</h3>
      <p>
          Aesthetic Attraction is all about someone's appearance. It's a focus on what
          one finds as 'beautiful'. It doesn't usually include a desire for either a sexual
          relationship or one of romantic interest. For example, you may be interested in
          the looks of a model in one of those odd perfume advertisements on TV, but you have
          no desire for a sexual relationship or even to get to know them at all.
